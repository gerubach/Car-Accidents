# Car-Accidents
This is an interactive heat map of car accident data by state for the continental United States. The user can enter in a date range and specific metric (deaths per capita, deaths per accident, etc.) and the app will display a heat map of the specified metric in the specified date range. The accident data all comes from the file labdata20SU21 and the population data comes from nst-est2019-01, which can be found on the US Census website: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-state-total.html.

The file example.png is a picture of a sample run of the app. If you would like to run the app yourself, you can do so at this link: https://rainbowschubert.shinyapps.io/Car-accidents-continental-US/. If you would like to run the app natively on your computer, you must have R and R Shiny installed and download all the files and put them all in a folder named "R" (no quotes). Then run app.R.
